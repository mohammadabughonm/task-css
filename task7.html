        Opera did not remain confined to court audiences for long. In 1637, the idea of a "season" (often during the 
        carnival) of publicly attended operas supported by ticket sales emerged in Venice. Monteverdi had moved to the
         city from Mantua and composed his last operas, Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria and L'incoronazione di Poppea, for
          the Venetian theatre in the 1640s. His most important follower Francesco Cavalli helped spread opera throughout 
          Italy. In these early Baroque operas, broad comedy was blended with tragic elements in a mix that jarred some educated
           sensibilities, sparking the first of opera's many reform movements, sponsored by the Arcadian Academy, which came to be 
           associated with the poet Metastasio, whose libretti helped crystallize the genre of opera seria, which became the leading 
           form of Italian opera until the end of the 18th century. Once the Metastasian ideal had been firmly established, comedy in 
           Baroque-era opera was reserved for what came to be called opera buffa. Before such elements were forced out of opera seria, 
           many libretti had featured a separately unfolding comic 
        plot as sort of an "opera-within-an-opera". One reason for this was an attempt to attract members of the 
        growing merchant class, newly wealthy, but still not as cultured as the nobility, to the public opera houses.
         These separate plots were almost immediately resurrected in a separately developing tradition that partly derived
          from the commedia dell'arte, a long-flourishing improvisatory stage tradition of Italy. Just as intermedi had once been performed in between the acts of stage plays, operas in the new comic genre of intermezzi, which developed largely in Naples in the 1710s and 1720s, were initially staged during the intermissions of opera seria. They became so popular, however, that they were soon being offered as separate productions.

Opera seria was elevated in tone and highly stylised in form, 
usually consisting of secco recitative interspersed with long da capo arias.
 These afforded great opportunity for virtuosic singing and during the golden 
 age of opera seria the singer really became the star. The role of the hero was usually
  written for the high-pitched male castrato voice, which was produced by castration of 
  the singer before puberty, which prevented a boy's larynx from being transformed at puberty.
   Castrati such as Farinelli and Senesino, as well as female sopranos such as Faustina Bordoni,
    became in great demand throughout Europe as opera seria ruled the stage in every country except France.
     Farinelli was one of the most famous singers of the 18th century. Italian opera set the Baroque standard.
      Italian libretti were the norm, even when a German composer like Handel found himself composing the likes of
       Rinaldo and Giulio Cesare for London audiences. Italian libretti remained dominant in the classical period as well, for example in the operas of Mozart, who wrote in Vienna near the century's close. Leading Italian-born composers of opera seria include Alessandro Scarlatti, Antonio Vivaldi and Nicola Porpora.[9]
